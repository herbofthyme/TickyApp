TickyApp is an improvement upon using checkboxes in google sheets (tickysheets) to select freeforms and relationship tags in Ao3 Challenges. In TickyApp, you sort tags into prompts all on one page —— without having to break your flow and switch between sheet pages. And you can make as many prompts as you'd like, without having to clunkily copy-paste columns.

Note. "Open Tickysheet" does not yet work. There will be more features to come, but please let me know if you find any bugs.
